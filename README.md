# FairMedFM

## Abstract
The advent of foundation models (FMs) in healthcare offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance medical diagnostics through automated classification and segmentation tasks. However, these models also raise significant concerns about their fairness and ethics, especially in diverse and underrepresented populations. Currently, there is no automated pipeline to benchmark the fairness performance of FMs for medical imaging. To fill this gap, we introduce \ours, the first framework for FM fairness research in medical imaging. \ours~encompasses all critical stages of applying a FM: from data preprocessing and FM integration to various downstream tasks, including classification and segmentation. It supports a wide range of medical datasets and sensitive attributes, enabling extensive evaluations across different modalities and applications. Our framework incorporates multiple adaptation strategies such as zero-shot learning, linear probing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and prompt-based segmentation. Furthermore, \ours~integrates common bias mitigation techniques directly into these models. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present a systematic and comprehensive pipeline for medical FMs, covering every aspect from data handling to fairness evaluation. (2) Our framework supports extendible functionalities and applications, ensuring flexibility and robustness in evaluating FMs. (3) We provide an exhaustive analysis from multiple perspectives, offering new insights into the utility and fairness of medical FMs. This benchmark serves as a crucial platform for studying FM fairness in healthcare. It aims to guide the development of more equitable healthcare technologies over the long term. \ours~will be open-sourced and maintained to ensure sustained benefits to the health informatics community. The library of \ours~is available at \url{https://github.com/Nanboy-Ronan/FairMedFM}.
